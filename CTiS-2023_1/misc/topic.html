  <h1>Autonomous Robot Soldiers</h1>
</div>

<h4><p>Brief:<p></h4>

<p>Throughout the years, technology has played an increasingly significant role in the area of modern warfare, with one notable example being autonomous weapons systems, which are systems that are able to identify and engage targets without human intervention (Baecker 2019). Because of the exponential advancement and limitless potential of artificial intelligence (AI), as well as the development of modern robotics and military technology, autonomous weapons have achieved new heights, with increased effectiveness and deployment capabilitie</p>

<p>Baecker (2019) claims that robot soldiers "will likely move from labs to real deployment in the very near future" (p. 177). Multiple countries, namely Russia, China, and the United States have demonstrated their robot soldier technology and are heavily investing in the research and development of AI.</p>

<h4><p>Justification:<p></h4>

<p>Exploring the topic of robot soldiers allows us to evaluate the potential advantages and challenges associated with their use. Many supports argue that autonomous weapons, including robot soldiers, can enhance military capabilities by increasing precision, speed, and operational efficiency. They can potentially reduce human casualties and minimize the physical and psychological toll on soldiers. However, despite the aforementioned opportunities, concerns still exist regarding the potential for malfunction, hacking, misuse of such systems, as well as many other risks, which can potentially lead to escalation and unintended loss of lives. Examining these pros and cons helps in forming opinions and policies regarding the development, deployment, and regulation of robot soldiers. </p>

<p>The increasing use of artificial soldiers in warfare also raises ethical considerations. Robot soldiers have the potential to operate without direct human control, leading to concerns about the lack of human judgment and accountability in critical decision-making processes. Exploring this topic also allows us to dive into the ethical implications of delegating lethal force to autonomous systems, including questions about responsibility, and the potential for unintended consequences. </p>
